# Splash Feature Implementation

This document explains the splash feature implemented using **Feature-Based Architecture**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The splash feature follows the same **Feature-Based Architecture** pattern established for the auth feature:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI components for the loading screen

## 📁 File Structure

```
lib/features/splash/
├── splash.dart                    # Feature barrel export
└── presentation/
    └── pages/
        └── splash_page.dart       # Splash screen UI
```

## 🎨 Features

### **Beautiful Loading Screen**
- Gradient background with brand colors
- App logo with shadow effects
- App name and tagline
- Animated loading indicator using `flutter_spinkit`
- Professional typography with Google Fonts

### **Responsive Design**
- Works on all screen sizes
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Material Design principles

## 🚀 Usage

### **Import the Feature**
```dart
import 'package:client_app/features/splash/splash.dart';
```

### **Use in App**
```dart
// Used automatically in AuthWrapper during authentication check
if (state is AuthLoading) {
  return const SplashPage();
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

The splash screen is shown:
- **During app startup** while authentication status is being checked
- **During login process** when authentication is in progress
- **As a loading state** for any authentication operations

## 🎨 Visual Elements

1. **Gradient Background**: Blue to purple gradient
2. **App Logo**: Circular container with delivery truck icon
3. **Typography**: Google Fonts Poppins for consistency
4. **Loading Animation**: Wandering cubes spinner
5. **Shadows**: Subtle shadows for depth

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **Animation**: Add fade-in animations for elements
2. **Progress Indicator**: Show loading progress percentage
3. **App Version**: Display current app version
4. **Network Status**: Show connection status
5. **Branding**: Add company branding elements

## 📝 Notes

- The splash screen uses the same design language as other app screens
- It's automatically shown during authentication state loading
- No state management needed for this simple feature
- Uses existing app dependencies (flutter_spinkit, google_fonts)

This splash feature provides a professional first impression and smooth loading experience for users.
